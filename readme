Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Import the `lsb` module from the `stegano` library:

```python
from stegano import lsb
```

This line imports the module necessary for performing least significant bit (LSB) steganography operations.

2. Define variables for the file paths:

```python
img = "path/to/your/image.png"
new_img = "path/to/save/hidden/image.png"
```

These variables hold the paths to the original image (`img`) and the path where the new image with the hidden message will be saved (`new_img`).

3. Define the message to be hidden:

```python
msg = "Type your message here"
```

This variable contains the message that you want to hide within the image. Replace `"Type your message here"` with the actual message you want to hide.

4. Hide the message within the image:

```python
lsb.hide(img, message=msg).save(new_img)
```

The `lsb.hide()` function is used to hide the message (`msg`) within the image specified by `img`. The resulting image with the hidden message is then saved to the path specified by `new_img`.

5. Reveal the hidden message from the image:

```python
revealed_message = lsb.reveal(new_img)
```

The `lsb.reveal()` function is used to extract the hidden message from the image saved at `new_img`. The revealed message is stored in the variable `revealed_message`.

6. Print the hidden message:

```python
print("Hidden message:", revealed_message)
```

Finally, the hidden message is printed to the console.

In summary, this code allows you to hide a message within an image using LSB steganography and then retrieve and display the hidden message.
